{"id":"nba_predictions-3","title":"Fix mobile standings view first user row visibility","description":"Fixing mobile standings view sticky positioning - REVISED APPROACH\n\nInitial attempts failed - reverting to closer-to-original approach.\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:\nThe original code had sticky positioning for BOTH the team header row AND the first user row to keep both visible during scrolling. My attempt to disable first-row stickiness caused it to be hidden.\n\nCORRECT SOLUTION:\nRestore the sticky positioning for the first user row BUT increase its z-index to ensure it appears ABOVE the team header row instead of being covered by it.\n\nZ-INDEX LAYERING (top to bottom):\n1. First user row cells: z-40 (highest - appears above everything)\n2. Conference header div: z-20\n3. Team header User/Pts cells: z-20 (horizontal stickiness)\n4. Team header thead: z-10 (vertical stickiness)\n5. Other user rows: z-10\n\nPOSITIONING:\n- Conference header: sticky top-0\n- Team header: sticky with top = conferenceHeaderHeight  \n- First user row: sticky with top = conferenceHeaderHeight + teamHeaderHeight\n\nCHANGES IN LeaderboardDetailPage.jsx:\n- Lines 1223, 1321: Restored hasStickyPosition = mobileFirstRowStickyTop \u003e 0 (was false)\n- Lines 1228, 1326: Increased first row z-index from z-20 to z-40 (was z-30 originally, tried z-20, now z-40)\n- Lines 1227, 1325: stickyCellStyle gets mobileFirstRowStickyStyle when hasStickyPosition is true\n\nThis ensures:\n- Conference header visible at top\n- Team header row visible and sticky below conference header\n- First user row visible and sticky below team header (with higher z-index to prevent overlap)\n- All other user rows scroll normally","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-27T19:20:52.815986-04:00","updated_at":"2025-10-28T00:04:02.788539-04:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T00:04:02.788539-04:00"}
{"id":"nba_predictions-4","title":"Fix mobile standings view first user row visibility","description":"Fixed mobile standings view sticky positioning issue - corrected approach.\n\nRoot cause: First user row had sticky positioning that caused it to overlap with team header row.\n\nFinal solution:\n1. Conference header div: sticky top-0 z-20 (stays at viewport top)\n2. Team header (thead): sticky z-10 with style={{top: conferenceHeaderHeight}} (sticks below conference header)\n3. User/Pts th cells: sticky left-0/left-[80px] z-20 (horizontal stickiness only for scrolling)\n4. Team logo th cells: no sticky (inherit vertical stickiness from thead parent)\n5.
